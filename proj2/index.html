			<h1>Overview</h1>
			<p>
				For this project, I implemented de Casteljau's algorithm to build Bezier Curve and surfaces, calculated area-weighted vertex normals for Phong shading, and loop subdivison.
				Now I can construct a teapot from points, give it nice shading and upsample it to a higher resolution.
				It was fantastic to be able to implement what we learned in lecture and see it in action. I now have better appreication for the actual effect of what we learned.

			<h1>Task 1 </h1>
			<p>de Casteljau's algorithm recursively apply linear interpolations between 2 points on a curve. It stops when there is one final point. 
				I implemented evaluateStep to evalute one step of the de Casteljau's algorithm by looping through 2 adjecent points on the curve and performing linear interpolation.

			<h1>Task 2 </h1>
			<p>
				de Casteljau's algorithm can be extended to a surface by first performing thr algorithm on each row of the surface, and then once again from the resulting points.
				I implemented evaluate1D to repeatedly call evaluate from Part I until there is only 1 point left. I then implemented evaluate to first call evaluate1D on each row of the surface, and then call evaluate1D on the resulting points.

			<h1>Task 3 : Area-Weighted Vertex Normals</h1>
			<p>
				Using a do-while loop, I successively traversed all the neighboring vertexs of the given vertex. 
				For each vertex, I defined a vector between the given vertex and the current vertex, and another vector between the given vertex and the next vertex.
				I calculated the normal by taking the cross product of the two vectors, which is equivalent to the normal vector of their face. 
				I also calculated the area of the triangle by taking 0.5 * of the norm of the normal vector. 
				Then, I found the vector normal of the given vertex as the sum of the normal vectors of all the faces that the given vertex is a part of, weighted by the area of the face.
				Finally, I normalized the vector normal of the given vertex.

		<h1>Task 4 : Edge Flip</h1>
			<p>
				I first drew out a diagram with all the vertices, edges, halfedges, and faces of the mesh.
				I labeled each vertex, edge, halfedge, and face with a number.
				I then drew out a diagram of the mesh after the edge flip.
				In my implementation, I first checked if the edge is a boundary edge. If it is, I returned nothin.
				Otherwise, I declare all vertices, edges, halfedges, and faces that are involved in the edge flip according to my diagram.
				I then reassigned all of their attributes to the new values based on my diagram.

				Thankfully I didn't have to debug this.

		<h1>Task 5 : Edge Split</h1>
			<p>
				I first drew out a diagram with all the vertices, edges, halfedges, and faces of the mesh.
				I labeled each vertex, edge, halfedge, and face with a number.
				I then drew out a diagram of the mesh after the edge split.
				In my implementation, I first checked if the edge is a boundary edge. If it is, I returned nothin.
				Otherwise, I declare all vertices, edges, halfedges, and faces that are involved in the edge split according to my diagram.
				I also declared 1 new vertex, 3 new edges, 6 new halfedges, and 2 new faces.
				I then reassigned all of their attributes to the new values based on my diagram.
				I calculated the position of the new vertex by taking the average of the two vertices that the edge is between.
			
				I made some careless mistakes while reassigning their attributes. 
				I successfully debugged by using the check_for statements, and making sure that the attributes of the new vertices, edges, halfedges, and faces were correct.

			<h1>Task 6 : Loop Subdivision for Mesh Upsampling</h1>
			<p>
				I frist computed the new positions for the vertices in the mesh using the formula given in class. I marked these vertices as old.
				I then looped through the orginal edges and computed the positions of its midpoints using the formula given in class.
				I then split each original edge in the mesh and assigned the new position of each new vertex to be the new position of the edge (calculated in the previous step).
				I then flipped any new edge that connects a new vertex with an old vertex.
				Finally, I assigned the positions of each vertex to its new position.

				Here is the result of loop subdivision on a cube.

				Sharp corners and edges disappeared after successively subdivision. But the new figure is no longer symmetrical. 
				Certain corners seem to be emphasized. I messed around with edge splitting, and it does seem to reduce the effect of smoothening, but now the mesh looks funny.

			<img src="./task6-1-7.png" alt="cube" style="width:304px;height:228px;">
			<p>
				After successively loop division, the cube does become assymtrical. 
				I suspect this is because of the diagonal edge on the face of the cube. 
				Since each face only has one diagonal edge, the new faces as a result of edge flip and split is not evenly distributed on the orignal face of the cube, yield assymetry.
				I was able to reduce the assymmetry by pre-spliting each edge as shown in the photo below.

				And it does seem to work!

			<p>
				I did run into some bugs, but that was thankfully solved by using the check_for statements. I also had to modify my code in part 5 to indicate which edges are new and which are old.
